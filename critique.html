<u>Design is a search problem</u>
<br><br><br>
“Talking about design is hard because design is hard,” Mike Bostock believes that not every design principle leads to success (Bostock 2014). Design principle is the specific algorithm that was chosen for tacking specific problem. There are multiple algorithms that could be used to solve a single problem; however, each of them has its own pitfall and constraint. The decision making of choosing the right design principle really depends on what messages that designers want to tell the users. In Mike Bostock piece <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">“Visualizing Algorithms”</a></li>, he displays a series of algorithms that tackles different aspects of a single problem; meanwhile, he also recognizes that each algorithms generates different outcomes and pitfalls; therefore, the key of a visualization piece is learning to choose algorithms based on the problem’s constrains and leveraging the strength of each algorithm after repetitive testings.

One of the pieces in “Visualizing Algorithms” that interests me most is “Sampling”. This piece is inspired by Poisson-disc distribution in our vision. He found that Mitchell’s best-candidate algorithm could be used to replicate Poisson-disc distribution. He tested different algorithm to seek a faster and better algorithm that would best to do the random distribution of the dots without having any dots too closely or too far from each others. Comparing the “The Starry Night” painted by Vincent van Gogh and its reproduction by using “Sampling”, Mike believes human intellect does better than finding patterns in data. The conclusion of the Sampling is that the design principle itself that does not recognize a successful design comparing to human eye (Bostock 2014). Base on the conclusion, there is a problem raised: “Design is more subjective, and could not do as what computer science do to optimize the best algorithm that matches particular problem (Bostock 2014)”. Logical rules in the algorithm describe behaviors, but does not automatically generate the story that designers want to tell users. Meanwhile, it is also important to understand the perception and psychological limitations behind design, and not to treat design as a mathematical problem.

The other piece I found interesting is “Maze”. Mike Bostock uses maze as a metaphor to imply the reality design approaches are not linear but a maze, “we want to proceed to our destination but we ultimately don't know how to get there (Bostock 2014)”. In this case, he applies Prim’s algorithm to construct a minimum spanning tree. The root starts at bottom left corner, and white spanning tree branches are generated and traveled toward upper right corner. Each branch represents a different path without connecting to each other. However, this prim algorithm is not efficient in filling the rectangular space. Thus, he shows the other three options that all have strength in itself: depth-first traversal, lowest-weighted edge and looped erased random walks. Finally, he colors those different mazes to indicate structures and the outcomes turn out to be  interesting visual arts.

<br><br><br>
<u>Design principle leads to success?</u>
<br><br>
The examples of “Sampling” and “Maze” tell us Mike Bostock’s design principles and strategies but not how these methods were applied in the practice. Interestingly, Mike Bostock focus on the processes that reach to an optimized solution than the result itself. Throughout the process of selecting algorithm that best presents the attempt, he recognizes that failure is inevitable. Trail and error are necessary. Eventually, the goal of his project is not about integrating with users through data visualization but to really reveal the problems of design principles that causes inevitable failures and errors.

<br><br><br>
<u>Criticisms</u>

<br><br>
All the processes and discoveries from each phrase of visualization are neatly presented in a gif or video format. Even through understanding his principles and concepts by just clicking on the videos might be difficult, reading the descriptions he writes for each pieces are helpful. After really dive into his thoughtful processes, I found Mike Bostock establishes a clear attitude toward using data visualization and algorithms as design principles to reach the goal. However, I found some interactivity were not functioning well as it suppose to be. For example, the graphics do not follow the place where mouse clicked. It is true that interaction does not only happened when there are clicks-things on website but more dealing with powerful experiences with users on the other end (Baur 2017); however, if the logical stories behind the scene were also told in a gif format, it would strengthen the visualization piece. Furthermore, in order to display the gif, users have to click on the play button every time and gif were not in a looping format. Users are passively receiving the information from the gifs, and understanding esoteric stories by carefully reading all the instructions that were prescribed to each gif. Users might expect more interaction in his piece, since “interaction enables people to adjust a visualization to their own needs and ask it different questions (Baur 2017)”.
<br><br>
For example, in the “Maze” visualization, it would be interesting if users could set different variables to understand how a single move could make a huge change to the patterns of tree branches’ traveling paths; meanwhile, the overall graphics remain similar. Having all the possible options presented in a single gif might do better than presenting different all the options in separate gifs with paragraphs sandwiched between them. Users might easily lose track of a single step and spend time going back and forth to click into a gif every time.
<br><br>
However, the website is a designer’s blog where teaches people how to read complexities in data visualization. Eventually, I learned that complexities are actually generated by a simple and clear algorithm that conveys a straightforward message. Because of Big Data, infographics is becoming a predominant method to help people learn new information within a short period of time, and certainly it would outpaced by other modes of advanced interaction in the future (Lupi 2017). Users are trained to receiving more information at a given time than ever before. I recognize it is designers’ responsibility to teach people this new language. Showing from his visualization blog, Mike Bostock has successfully presented the complexity through using simple methods, and in turn, we learned new terms and visual languages as rewards after digesting his design process.
